 Hello, this is Marcelo Amancio. Welcome to my blog!

I am an experienced AI Researcher with a diverse background, having worked in roles such as Data Scientist, Machine Learning Engineer, Data Consultant, and Lecturer. Currently, I have stepped away from a PhD program to immerse myself in the world of Generative AI, specifically focusing on mastering Large Language Models (LLMs) for diverse applications.

Before the widespread adoption of GPTs & LLMs, those technologies were already my passion. One model I developed mapped *User Navigation* data into a LLM to better learn *Contextual Behavior* for UI/UX content optimization.
