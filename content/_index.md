 Hello, this is Marcelo Amancio. Welcome to my blog.

I am an experienced AI Researcher with a diverse background, having worked in roles such as Data Scientist, Machine Learning Engineer, Data Consultant, and Lecturer. Currently, I have stepped away from a PhD program to immerse myself in the world of Generative AI, specifically focusing on mastering Large Language Models (LLMs) for diverse applications.

Even Before the widespread adoption of GPTs I was working with LLMs - one interesting application was modeling *User Navigation* as words to learn *Contextual Behavior* in an UI/UX recommender model.
